# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to Pathfinding Visulizer!

This application visulizes three algorithms for finding the shortest path between two nodes. I designed this application because I wanted to learn algorithms in a more intuitive way. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it.
